Another simple Python script for downloading a images from a 8ch/4chan thread

Uses BeautifulSoup4 for parsing and httplib for https connections (does not verify certificate)

TODO:
 * Handle timeouts and retry downloads
 * Handle CTRL+C in threads correctly
 * Check command line arguments
 * Error handling in general
 * OS agnostic + test on linux
